i woke up today under a star-dotted sky   
i was shivering, and the car battery had died   
breathless as the sky lit up, two shadows in the dark   
and two million fireworks   
over the empty state park   

we had slept in the back seat, wrapped in four blankets   
a girl i met in college, a wonderful accident   
in my arms, four eyes, two mouths   
shallow, soft breathing   
staring into the dark of the car, into the dark of the sky   
couldnâ€™t believe what i was seeing
