the sky stays bright   
deep into night   
the city lights    
accompany   
my wayward fight   
back to my bed   
took years to find   
a way to end   
the hours gone   
lost on my phone   
my laptop, books   
the time they took   
remains no more   
sheets on my floor   
my bedroom bare   
and unaware   
i stumble back   
my mind intact   
barely   
as i tumble forth   
into my bed   
shapes in my head   
the lights dim slow   
as my eyes close.   

and into sleep   
i find some peace.
