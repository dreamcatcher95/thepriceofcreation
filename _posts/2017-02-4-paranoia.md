the news articles screamed   
"danger"   

...   

danger in the woods   
and lightness in the trees,   
the prospect of   
a peaceful night   
seems absurd   
to me.   

the blanket pushes   
down   
and the voices   
grow loud,   
screaming   
"danger"   

and the hordes huddled   
in the frigid   
cold, winter wind.   
i know they wouldn't win,   
drowned out by sirens   
screaming   
"danger"   

and all the ink   
became blurry   
on the news articles   
while i   
scribbled   
"danger"   

as the television   
droned   
in the tiny cafe   

i was trapped   

all those mouths   
eyes   
faces   
whispering   

"danger"
