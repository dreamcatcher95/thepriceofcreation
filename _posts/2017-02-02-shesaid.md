she said...   

"it doesn't count.   
he let me down.   

and lay me down   
on the cold ground   
and entered me.   
for once, could be   
a stranger, new.   
and then i knew.   

as he pushed through   
my softened bloom,   
it bloomed to be   
necessity   
to leave the tent.   
the sunlight sent   
for me that morning   
and left him mourning.   

left him bare,   
i wasn't scared   
but terrified   
of my long fight   
dissolving to   
a useless fool's   
forgiveless ruse.   
but now, old news.   

that naive girl   
trapped in his world,   
his fantasies   
could not hold me.   

and so i fled   
awoke the dead   
gave birth to me   
and now i'm free."
