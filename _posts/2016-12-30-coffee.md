i love little coffee shops,   
mostly empty   
when we talk   
we whisper
i hope i remember this,   
because someday soon we’ll miss   
the mochas, lattes, frappes and tea   
when they’re just memories   
to ponder in between the rush   
of office spaces, nameless faces   
i’ll hold onto those words so tight   
we shared through those long, sleepless nights   
for once the morning wakes, it seems   
just one more wistful, distant dream.
