it was cold this morning   
and i stepped into the icy air without a jacket   
without gloves, no scarf and no purpose   
just started walking, followed the streets through the city   

had my headphones in, some soft guitar strumming   
some soft swooning   
perfect soundtrack to slow pacing   
unintentional, just wandering   

like a little wisp of smoke   
floating off the end of a burnt-up cigarette   
joining the clouds from smokestacks, factories, car exhausts   
spreading out over the city   
over the little quiet houses,   
over lines of children waiting for school buses   
over university dorms, over traffic and trees,   
over lakes, the animals and the inmates   
and   
reaching out into the city, i roam   
stepping over worn pavement,   
over cracks in cobblestone, over old footprints   
crossing paths with the past   

settling, sliding, squeezing between rows of   
houses, people, space   
i meander, wander to find a peaceful place
