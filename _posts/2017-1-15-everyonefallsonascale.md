everyone falls on a scale   
and of the people   
i as well   
discover in myself a piece   
of comparing my history   
my sanity   
my unmet needs   
and my hidden   
shortcomings   
Â 
everyone falls on a scale   
the packaged goods   
this show-and-tell   
taped up on billboards   
i track scoreboards   
i find faults   
and   
hold the off-note
