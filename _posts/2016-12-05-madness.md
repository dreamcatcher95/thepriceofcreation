i woke up today in a crowd of people   
not sure how i got there   
a sea of strangers   
quick, stolen glances   
moving, going somewhere far away   
and i was far away   
my throat clenched as the words sizzled away   
i couldnâ€™t find the exit   

blurring lines, movements stuttering   
faces splattered, aimless wandering   
obscured shapes, the window blinds were drawn   
and in the swirling madness, i was all alone
