i was bored   
so i came to this little coffee shop   
at the corner of   
john wesley dobbs and boulevard.   

i see a yellow, orange pencil point   
skyscraper building top,   
dim lights inside   
at the counter, two men talk.   
traffic on the road,   
i write and i watch.    

tried to come here all week   
well, i made it   
and   
i just had to move my feet.
