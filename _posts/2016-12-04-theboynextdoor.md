secondhand smoke   
seeps under my door   
comes from the boy next door   
he smokes too much    

every night, flickering lights through his window   
a somber, sad voice   
and i can’t find my voice   
i can’t find my lock    

a messy room   
and the clock flashes red   
eyes worn, bulging red   
early morning, i think the boy is dead    

stepping out of my inner circle   
move down the hallway   
lights dimmed in the hallway   
someone bled white in the twilight    

door opens and the   
boy   
sad boy   
comes out with a toy    

a fresh cigarette   
a lighter   
deep breaths, and i feel much lighter   
he lights one end, puts the other in my mouth
