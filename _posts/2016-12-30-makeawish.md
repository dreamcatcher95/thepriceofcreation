i got a letter yesterday,   
make-a-wish.   
they want to know   
what i want.   
“nothing,” i want to tell them.   
but what a waste,   
a wish made in bad taste.   
so i think…   
…   
i’ve traveled all across the land   
from budapest to switzerland.   
seen prague and rome,   
worn cobblestones,   
but now where is there left to go?   
i’m still alive   
so why should i   
relish in this needless prize?   
three years ago   
i might have known   
but now, my feet firm, ground below   
reminds me of what i’ve become   
and how i still have yet to grow.   

a wish to meet a famous man   
perhaps,   
that would make me feel best.   
or maybe a wish for someone else   
can fabricate false selflessness.   

well…   
wishes come in many forms   
so ask,   
a wish for nothing more.   
an end to loss of dignity   
forgiveness for my apathy   
to let the worry cease,   
to free   
myself from this anxiety.   
since what i want and what i need   
blurs to become a helpless plea,   
so often   
we desire things   
that can’t fulfill our fantasies.   

so as this year draws to a close,   
the end approaches   
and i know   
each year before i’ve always dreamed   
of perfection,   
of sanity,   
of no regrets   
and ideally, i’ll find a way to finally   
be happy in my misery   
that artificial casualty   

of life.   
of life.   
i fight to speak,   
i write these words and stitch my seams   
and rise again, new year begun.   
i ask,   
return my life to me.
