the first day of the year   
was dreary,   
wet,   
my soggy steps   
on darkened sidewalks,   
skies subdued.   
rain clouds bringing heavy news.   

we hurried home.   
nobody knew   
but i had told myself   
that i   
would find   
something happy in the grime,   
something beautiful   
behind   
the rain clouds   
crowding the gray sky,   
something wonderful   
despite   
the knowledge that this year anew   
is nothing special.   
it’s just   
we choose…   

to make each day a chance to prove   
to cynics, cowards, thieves, and fools   
who squander, steal, use their time   
for petty games, safe from the pain   
of pressure,   
trying something new,   
of failing, casting sheltered youth   
away.   
the others knew,   
but now i’m learning   
sometimes life leads us astray   
…   
the fog obscures   
and fights the daylight,   
simple understated hues.   
but slowly with my understanding   
of my path,   
clouds start to pass.   

the sunlight drives the rain away.   
colors burst from lifeless gray.   
the somber sky begins to fade.   
and gives birth to a fierce, new day.
