from afar,   
everyone is the same.   
from this spot at the table   
in the center of this coffee shop,   
the two girls to my right,   
the man across from me,   
with his headphones on.   
…   
all these faces buried in laptops.   
in journals   
in books   
they all look   
like strangers.   
and i savor   
my silence,   
but our distance is violence.   
…   
our little glances,   
misaligned chances.   
but what would i say?   
they all look the same.   
so perfectly packaged,   
scarves bundled, coats fastened.   
…   
i see smiles, laughter, and awe   
on my face at the thought   
of meeting a stranger,   
of holding the stare,   
finding for each other   
a few words to share.   

then i catch eyes observing   
and i glance that way,   
she turns her head quickly   
drags her pen on a page.
