she comes over some nights,   
and without a blanket   
we lay   
rigid together.   

i feel her,   
but glass eyes hardly speak.   
and these encounters   
leave me nothing to keep.   
for once we sleep,   
my mind pools   
in the fractured deep   
of the routine touch,   
the simple lust   
of bodies lost   
in stuttered speech,   
waiting for   
some helpless peace.   

and the bed creaks.   
and the long weeks   
end in long nights,   
side by side   
we bump and grind   
but every time   
just not enough,   
so i rewind   
to buy some time.   

before the morning stretches dead.   
before our love turns into dread.   
until the daylight passes too   
from the window above   
me and you.
