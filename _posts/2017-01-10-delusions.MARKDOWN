i enjoy being deluded
i watched the movie with
wide eyes
when she kissed the
unemployed, grungy boy
in the dead, damp bedroom
with the peeling walls
i peeled my eyes
and asked why
my life
couldn’t be that

i enjoy being deluded
so i remembered how the music played
when they locked eyes
entering the jazz joint
i pointed
look!
my life
could be that

i enjoy being deluded
so i imagined myself
there
and the scenes faded
in and out
they danced
back and forth
and in and out of that dream
i sat rapt
and it’s a fact

that once the screen dimmed black
and we picked up
our trash
our popcorn and soda
my fantasy and
delusions
and walked back out
under streetlights
i knew
i couldn’t
be there
