between solitude and loneliness   
wind blows a tree   
the roots are stretched   
my mirror holds a sordid scene   
soft light scatters   
ignites the seams   
and pulls the fabric thread by thread   
apart   
a shadow in the dark.   
a sliver, shreds of dignity   
are left   
clothes piled up on the bed   
no words, no speaking in this house   
just memories   
and days without   
a passerby, a breeze, a friend   
the rotting of the tree quickens
