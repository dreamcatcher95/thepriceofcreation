i woke up this morning   
shivering under a thin blanket.   
when my alarm rang the first time   
i jumped out of bed   
and saw through my window,   
obscuring the buildings   
resting like a heavy blanket over the few cars on the highway,   
the few people still awake, celebrating endlessly   
scared of what might happen once they stop,   
the few people just now opening their eyes   
maybe after a long night of revelries,   
or a night alone, peaceful and plain   
they’ll see it too.   

the fog.   
the soft, white, gray haze   
diffusing the early morning sunlight   
from the new year’s sun.   
filling the gaps, the empty spaces,   
it covers everyone.
