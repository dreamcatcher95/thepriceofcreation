“there’s more to life than silly toys”   
he gently told the little boys.   
i heard him too   
but at that age,   
ignored his words, no self concern.   

those little boys became big boys.   
and grew accustomed to the noise   
of keyboard clicks,   
the whine persists   
and some nights i still hear that voice.   

“there’s more to life than rotting ghosts”   
the dead screens of your   
laptop, phone   
provide no comfort,   
shield no cold,   
and now i’m even more alone.
