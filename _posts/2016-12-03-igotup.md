woke up today on a cold bench   
i was shivering, blanket blown away   
sitting next to the highway   
sun rising behind the clouds   
phone dead, music silent    
…    
my eyes scan the highway traffic   
cars winding north   
mountains   
i woke up alone today and i’m not sure   
where i go now   

the fall leaves look beautiful this time of year   
i’ve heard   
what else?    

i’ve heard people moving north   
i’ve heard people find things to do   
so i get up    

i take out my silent headphones   
my watch, nine am   
time waits for me, i move slowly   
but then faster, north, to the autumn    

i haven’t seen the mountains in years   
do the leaves still change colors?   
does the wind still wash, chilly, over the trees?   
do the hills still speak to me?   
i got up, time to see
