i woke up in the middle of the night   
stumbled out of bed, clock flashing red numbers,   
bright   
mumbling from the living room, coarse breaths   
stepping out of my bedroom   
a cold breeze on my neck   
i step around the corner, arch my head to see   

my own dead, black eyes staring back at me.
