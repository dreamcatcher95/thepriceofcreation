everything ends eventually   
while i write in the corner of this hushed,   
muted library   
third floor booth   
regrets and a stunted, wasted youth   

resolutions, nothing changes   
just false idealism   
lies on yellow pages   

going through old journals, poems   
my past selves strangers   
i donâ€™t know them   

plans to change, improve   
a once optimistic view   
now traded for desperation   
another year   
just another variation
