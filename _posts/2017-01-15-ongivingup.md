once the fire dies   
and the alarm rings   
deaf to closed eyes   
warm inside   
a bundled bed, but   
what ever happened   
to that insight?   

early mornings   
once for coffee   
pass by empty   
for all that talking,   
you lasted just a   
few short weeks.   
back then   
you never thought of stopping   

thought of jotting   
all your thoughts down   
now your thoughts drown   
thought you had found   
remedy or antidote   
for stress and pressure   
they creep back up now   

pages torn from   
notebooks, journals   
pages thrown into   
fires, dumpsters   

and your lone pencil   
sits forever   
on your bedside   
whole world tongue tied
