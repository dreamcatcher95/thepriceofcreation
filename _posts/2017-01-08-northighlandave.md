sat up quickly   
out of bed,   
alarm still ringing   
in my head.   
the shower stream   
woke me up,   
and forced me out   
into pale sun.   

made haste, lay waste   
to yesterday.   
and found a place   
north highland ave.   
…   
i haven’t had this peace in weeks.   
i watch the street,   
the crowds arrive.   
they fill the empty space inside,   
but this spot by the door   
is mine.
