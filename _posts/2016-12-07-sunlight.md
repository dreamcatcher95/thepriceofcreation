the rain clouds disappeared overnight   
and i woke up to a sunlit city   
glare from the highway cars   
clear streets, dry rooftops   
the vase on my living room table   
glittering   
and shimmering above the skyscrapers   
above the windows, the houses, the sidewalks, the crowds rushing back and forth   
sunlight
