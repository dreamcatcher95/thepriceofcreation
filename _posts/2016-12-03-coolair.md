inspiration   
some memories and some adventures   
go outside   
find it again   
you loved that once   
a long, winding drive to the mountains   
a slow, winding drive and music   
windows down   
wind howling through the car   
through your hair   
nobody else, alone   
but happy alone   
nobody else and open air. no words   
breathless   
sunset, shadows, a photograph   
put that away and enjoy, breathe   

live    
in these trees, these leaves, these shadows,   
the sun laying down   

“stay here,” the forest whispers softly   
you couldn’t hear those words on the highway   
on the streets   
in the city   
you chased those whispers   
calling from some memory of fall   
…   
real or imagined, shadows lengthen on the trail   
and the cool air turns stale
