i lost my pencil last night   
probably under a pile of clothes   
disappeared right under my nose.   

where’s everyone hiding?   
i never know, move far too slow.   
 
and with this makeshift splinter   
i plucked from a rotting flower,   
i scratch   
brash   
can’t find my words   
  
my cursive is rough   
the thought’s enough   
but on paper   
smears   
smudges appear   
like forceful tears   
i get so near, then   
disappears   
...   
sputter   
spit   
scream   
and me   

and you   
across the room   
these words are no use.
