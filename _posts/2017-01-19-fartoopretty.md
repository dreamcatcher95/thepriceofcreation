she’s far too pretty.   
what a pity   
that every time   
her mind felt something,   
a thought or question to interject,   
a voice arose   
that sternly said   
“a girl like you   
should keep her silence,   
a wayward wish   
can bloom to violence   

against the seamless fabric   
stretched   
across your body on the bed”
