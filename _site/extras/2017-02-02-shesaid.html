<p>she said…</p>

<p>“it doesn’t count. <br />
he let me down.</p>

<p>and lay me down <br />
on the cold ground <br />
and entered me. <br />
for once, could be <br />
a stranger, new. <br />
and then i knew.</p>

<p>as he pushed through <br />
my softened bloom, <br />
it bloomed to be <br />
necessity <br />
to leave the tent. <br />
the sunlight sent <br />
for me that morning <br />
and left him mourning.</p>

<p>left him bare, <br />
i wasn’t scared <br />
but terrified <br />
of my long fight <br />
dissolving to <br />
a useless fool’s <br />
forgiveless ruse. <br />
but now, old news.</p>

<p>that naive girl <br />
trapped in his world, <br />
his fantasies <br />
could not hold me.</p>

<p>and so i fled <br />
awoke the dead <br />
gave birth to me <br />
and now i’m free.”</p>
